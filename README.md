# App_PillDora
Repository of the PAESAV 2019-2020.

This project was created as anextend to the University project, called PAE "Advanced Engineering Project".

The basements were to create a Telegram Bot which is already done in project :[PillDora](https://github.com/Evm7/PillDora).
As the project carried out successfully overcome all the expectatives with less time than expected, we were proposed to develop an Android Application to make even more simple, elegant, handy and useful for the users.

Here there is the code for the application:

## FUNCTIONS:

The Bot has plenty of functions which were used to help the users with their medications:
  - There is the possibility of introducing a ned medication or a prescription to the database, which is also handled in the project.
  - There is also the possibility to schedule some reminders for the user, which will be notified using Telegram to them. This notification allows to be responded in order to create some feedback and update having taken or not the medication.
  - Some history, inventory and curent treatments are also possible to be visualized using the Bot.
  - There is also the possibility to view all medications someone has to take using Calendar function, with inline handler calendar.
  
  ## AIMS
  The aim of the project was to make a Telegram App approachable for all ages. Therefore, we tried to make it as simple and elegant as possible. 
  Muliple functions can be executed just by single buttons pressings and making everything as visual as possible. Moreover, there is also the possibility to introduce inputs to the user by voice (recognizing some commands in different languages) or by image (with some computer vision algorithms we can detect Spaingh Medicines using CIMAs database).
  
  All Bot has the possibility to be reproduced in differnet languages and its handling is easy and flexible.
  
  ## DATABASE
  The DataBase incorporates some securty to avoid SQL injections and also does have some encryption in passwords.

  ## Providing Android Application based on HealthCare Assistant:
  The Application, which uses Android Studio, has some interesting algorithms created to dinamically change the xml files depending of the outputs given from the DataBase created for each user. It is interesting to prove the application and see that it fulfills of the needs of a user who wants to have a HealthCare Assistant App.
  Moreover, extending the Bot Project with this App project has been an outstanding success as it has improved significantly not only the elegance interface but also the handy interaction from user with all the information set.
  
  ### DrawBakcs:
  As the project was developed as a UPC subject, the time available was 3 months for both Telegram Bot (which was, theorically, the unique project), and in our case, the Android App. Therefore, we had no time to finish with all details but all functions works as expected.
